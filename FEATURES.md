# Serverless Image Watermarking - Enhanced Features

## 🎨 New Customization Options

### 1. **Watermark Color Selector**
- Choose any color for your watermark using the color picker
- Enter hex color codes manually (e.g., `#ff0000` for red)
- Default: White (`#ffffff`)
- **Tip**: Choose contrasting colors to make watermarks visible on any background!

### 2. **Watermark Position**
- **9 Position Options**:
  - Top Left, Top Center, Top Right
  - Middle Left, Center, Middle Right
  - Bottom Left, Bottom Center, Bottom Right
- Default: Bottom Right
- Position is disabled when using "Repeated Pattern" style

### 3. **Watermark Style**
- **Single Watermark**: Places one watermark at the selected position
- **Repeated Pattern**: Creates a tiled pattern across the entire image (great for copyright protection!)

### 4. **Rotation Angle**
- Rotate watermark from -45° to +45°
- Adjustable in 5° increments
- Perfect for diagonal watermarks!

## 💾 Storage Behavior

### What Gets Saved in Cloudinary:
- **Only the watermarked images** are permanently stored
- Stored in: `watermarked_images/` folder
- Original images are uploaded temporarily and then deleted automatically
- Each watermarked image has a unique timestamp-based name

### Why This Approach:
✅ Saves storage space  
✅ Keeps your Cloudinary organized  
✅ Only keeps the final processed images  
✅ Reduces clutter in your media library  

## 🚀 Usage Tips

2. **For Dark Images**: Use light watermark colors (white, yellow, etc.)
